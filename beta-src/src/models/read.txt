User visit the game page with param gameID

board.php receives gameID and create a $Game object.
    - I can't locate where this data is being queired.
    - at this point, we need $Game, $User, and $Member
    - Assume $User data will be available after auth, We can have a single API call to get both $Game and $Member data from wD_Games and wD_Members

With $Game, $User, and $Member data, generates context which includes
['gameID','userID','memberID','variantID','turn','phase','countryID','tokenExpireTime','maxOrderID']
    - board/orders/orderInterface.php line 318
    - at this point, we have basic game data without actual board/order data
